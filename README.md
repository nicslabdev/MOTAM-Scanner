# nRF52840 - Beacon scanner #

This is a Bluetooth 5 advertisements' scanner developed for [nRF52840 Dongle](https://www.nordicsemi.com/eng/Products/nRF52840-Dongle) and [nRF52840 Development Kit](https://www.nordicsemi.com/eng/Products/nRF52840-DK).

This application captures advertisements with extended advertising characteristic activated and BT5 PHYs: 2Mbps, 1Mbps and PHY Coded.

The application sends the captured advertisements through serial port.

This repository is part of [MOTAM project](https://www.nics.uma.es/projects/motam). This reads advertisements and filters it in order to show by serial port only the authenticated MOTAM beacons. nRF52840 will be connected by USB port to the [MOTAM gateway](https://github.com/nicslabdev/MOTAM-Gateway). MOTAM beacons report on the state of the environment, so the gateway will collect this information. By default, this application will show PHY Coded advertisements.

## Requeriments

This project uses:
-   nRF5 SDK version 15.2.0
-   S140 SoftDevice v6.1.0 API
-   nRF52840 Dongle (PCA10059) or nRF52840 PDK (PCA10056)

## Get started

You can find a hex folder with the **precompiled applications** for PCA10056 and PCA10059.

In order to program the application on the nRF52840, you can use [nRF Connect application for Desktop](https://www.nordicsemi.com/eng/Products/Bluetooth-low-energy/nRF-Connect-for-Desktop) from Nordic Semiconductor or nrfjprog (just in case you are using nRF52840 Development Kit).

> Note: This application uses S140 SoftDevice, so don't forget program
> SoftDevice hex file (you can find it in hex folder).

In order to stablish serial connection with your PC, you can use PUTTY if you are a Windows user or GNU Screen if you are a Linux user.

**PUTTY connection parameters:**

    Baud rate: 115.200
    8 data bits
    1 stop bit
    No parity
    HW flow control: None

**GNU screen**

    sudo screen /dev/ttyACM0 115200
    
Where */dev/ttyACM0* is the nRF52840 device. You can know what is the path of your nRF52840 connecting it and executing *dmesg* on UNIX terminal.

In case you are working on nRF52840 Development Kit:

- Use nRF USB connector (J3 connector) for **beacon scanner function**.
- Use MCU USB connector (J2 connector) in order to see logger messages.

## Compiling the applications

If you want to compile the project, you can use GCC and Eclipse. Put the downloaded folder into 
	
	\nRF5_SDK_15.2.0\examples\ble_central folder.
